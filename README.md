# Info
This branch stores relations between urls and MAL-IDs.
If the extension finds a matching name + site combo here, it will directly use the correlating MAL-ID.

# import.js
This is a Node.js File. It can import the cachefile outputted from the extension into this storage system. It will display stats about the current storage and display any missing name + site combos.
